# Adrenalina
Implementation (using Java) of the board game "Adrenalina".

Developed by Francesco Emanuele Stradi, Diego Savoia and Alexander Elvis Stanimirov.

The implementation follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) software design pattern.\
It is composed of a client and a server, both implemented as CLI (Command-Line Interface) executable jar files.\
The server supports both the socket and the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) interfaces to manage the communication between the client(s) and the server.

The complete set of rules is supported. Additionally, multiple games can be played simultaneously.

Tools like [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) were used in order to better manage the development process.\
Being Java an object-oriented programming language, the use of UML diagrams also helped during the design phase.
